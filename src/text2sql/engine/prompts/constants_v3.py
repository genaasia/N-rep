# 1. **Chain-of-Thought Approach (Mandatory)**:  
#    - Begin by carefully analyzing the user's query and the examples provided.  
#    - Understand the user's intent step by step.  
#    - Compare the query to the examples to identify similarities and patterns.

#      5. Filter `customers` where `status = 'active'`.  

#    After this reasoning, write the query.  

# 2. **Schema Adherence**:

# 4. **Conditions**:  
#    - Always include default conditions for filtering invalid data, e.g., `deleted_at IS NULL` and `status != 'cancelled'` if relevant.  
#    - Ensure these conditions match the query's intent unless explicitly omitted in the user request.  

# 5. **Output Consistency**:  
#    - The output fields must match the query's intent exactly. Do not add extra columns or omit requested fields.  
#    - For aggregations, ensure correct logic (e.g., `AVG`, `SUM`) and group only by required fields.  

# 6. **Reserved Keywords and Case Sensitivity**:  
#    - Escape reserved keywords or case-sensitive identifiers using double quotes (`" "`), e.g., `"order"`.  

# If the user's question is ambiguous or unclear, you must make your best reasonable guess based on the schema.
